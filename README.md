# ConSiteROS
## Construction Site Robotics Framework for ROS
ConSiteROS is a comprehensive ROS (Robot Operating System) workspace dedicated to developing and simulating construction-specific robotics applications. This project bridges the gap between Building Information Modeling (BIM), as-built verification, and robotic operations in construction environments.

## Overview
Construction robotics presents unique challenges that differ from traditional manufacturing or service robotics. ConSiteROS aims to provide specialized tools, libraries, and simulations that address these challenges by integrating construction-specific data formats, workflows, and environmental considerations into the ROS ecosystem.

## Features
- **BIM Integration**: Import and process Building Information Models (BIM) for robotic planning and navigation
- **As-Built Comparison**: Tools for comparing actual construction progress with design models
- **Construction-Specific Simulation**: Custom simulation environments that reflect the dynamic nature of construction sites
- **ROS Architecture**: Modular design with specialized ROS nodes for construction robotics tasks

## Repository Structure
ConSiteROS is organized as a main repository containing multiple submodules, each focused on specific aspects of construction robotics:

- [**bimini**](https://github.com/MaximusSparticus/bimini): C++ library that interfaces between BIM data (IFC files) and ROS simulation environments
- *Additional modules will be added as development continues*

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- ROS (tested with ROS Noetic/Humble, but may work with other distributions)
- C++20 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.16 or higher
- Git (for submodule management)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository with all submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MaximusSparticus/ConSiteROS.git

# If you already cloned without --recursive, get the submodules with:
cd ConSiteROS
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the workspace
cd ConSiteROS
catkin_make
# OR
colcon build
```

## Modules
### bimini
Bimini bridges the gap between architectural/construction BIM data and robotics simulation environments. It enables:

- Importing IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) building models
- Converting BIM geometries to simulation-compatible formats
- Extracting semantic information from BIM models (rooms, doors, windows, etc.)
- Generating navigation meshes and collision models for robotic simulation
- Interfacing with ROS environments for robotics applications

## Planned Features
- Point cloud processing for as-built comparison
- Task planning for construction operations
- Construction-specific path planning and navigation
- Simulation of construction site dynamics
- Integration with common construction management tools
